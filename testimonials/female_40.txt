Female, Age 40

Beth is an extremely knowledgeable trainer and cares about her clients total well being. I have trained with her for a little over a year and have seen such an improvement in my total body.

She keeps me motivated and always has a well planned, challenging session. She encourages me to push myself but in a safe way. She always shows me the proper way to do an exercise and answers any questions I have in a complete and thorough way.

Fitness was not something that I made a priority before meeting Beth but since she has been training me her knowledge and enthusiasm has encouraged me to make it a priority. Beth is truly a gem in her field and I feel lucky to have the privilege to learn from her.
