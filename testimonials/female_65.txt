Female, Age 65

I trained with Beth for two months. During that time I noticed a definite increase in my strength and endurance and at the end of the period my body fat percentage had dropped a little.

Beth's sessions were well planned, keeping in mind my specific needs. She is a very upbeat, pleasant person with whom to work and I look forward to working with her again in the future.
