Beth is an extremely knowledgeable trainer & someone who I always consult whenever I have a health or fitness-related question, or need a recommendation regarding a particular type of exercise. I've also noticed she's a very patient teacher, careful to take the time to explain how each of the exercises should be performed, and how & why they're beneficial to me.

I've also been very impressed with how much care & effort Beth puts into the training programs she makes for her clients. Some trainers I've been to will give you advice during the 1-on-1 session, but then you won't hear from them again. Beth makes sure to keep tabs on the exercises I'm doing on off days, and is happy to create a cardio program for me to use as a guide. We also discuss what exercises I can and cannot do on my own, during the time between our training sessions.

You can really tell that Beth loves what she does, and I would not hesitate recommending Beth to anyone looking for a trainer. She will not only motivate you, but she's also an extremely valuable resource when it comes to health & fitness!
