Female, Age 34

I am someone who has NEVER had a gym membership. I was never heavy, but always wanted to tone up and increase my flexibility. I always found the gym intimidating. My kids were both at school this year and I decided it was time to give the gym a try.

Upon joining, I had a complementary assessment done by Beth. She was so easy to talk to and made me feel so comfortable, that I spoke with her about doing some training sessions to help me get jump started and establish a routine.

After just a few sessions, I felt more comfortable navigating my way around the gym. Beth was so patient and took the time to thoroughly explain things to me (on many occasions, multiple times!)! She always made our sessions fun that it never seemed like work. Beth was able to help me modify my routine if I had difficulty with some of the equipment and always gave me options of different machines and weights that i could use to switch things up that I never get bored. Beth helped me put together a routine that I was able to use even on days when we were not training to help me meet my goals.

After two months of working with Beth I was going on vacation with my family. I felt fitter and more toned than I have felt in years! My initial feelings of I "have" to go to the gym turned into I "can't wait" to go to the gym. Beth gave me the motivation and encouragement to push myself a little harder to achieve the desired results. I found her exercises to be really exciting and fun and easy to do both at the gym and at home rather than restricting myself to one place.
